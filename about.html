 <h4>Seems like autumn has taken forever to come this year, but now that the cold days are back, what better way to comfort yourself than with a steaming cup of coffee? Just like the different origins and types of coffee, the websites of coffeehouses and cafes go from elegant, minimalist and strong black designs to warm coloured friendly sites and earthy, ecological designs depicting the origin of the product. If you don't make the coffee, but instead the coffee makes you, this post is for you. We can't give you the delicious black beverage, but we provide you with 30 caffeinated web designs to boost your day. Wake up and smell the websites!</h4>
